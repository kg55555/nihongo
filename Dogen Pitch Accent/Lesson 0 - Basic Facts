#Introduction

Japanese has a (dynamic intonation)
pitch accent system

Myth

1. Japanese intonation is flat
    
    So it's not important to study
    intonation, only pronunciation.
    Reasons - East Asian Language (Tonal)
    Japanese is not tonal, but it doesn't
    mean it's flat. English is not tonal,
    but if the stress is on the wrong syllable
    it sounds unnatural.
    
    Generally English has one stressed
    syllable, but Japanese may have multiple
    high mora. Words may not have an accent
    (going down), but they do move from
    low to high. Some do have an accent
    and move from low-high-low.
    
    Intonation may be vary from dialect
    to dialect, they are all consistent.
    However, foreign speakers may map their
    native sounds to Japanese, and thus feel
    like they are switching dialects every
    word
    
To develop a native like accent, it's
good to focus on pitch accent over grammar
and vocabulary for a period of time.

Ability to mimic foreign language sounds
deteriorates over time

Be in a state of phonetic awareness, focus
on the sounds and identify the pitch accent
pattern

Search for the pitch accent pattern in
words as well as phrases

Essential practices
    
1. Record yourself - 30 min word by word
shadowing material. Then 15/20 min analyzing

2. Limit exposure to non-native Japanese -
rewatch the same movie again and again. We want
to memorize words based on their sound rather
than spelling or kanji
