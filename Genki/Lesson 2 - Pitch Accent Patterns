###Rule 1

The pitch of the first and second mora in
every standalone word is different.

Either high-low or low-high

No word has two consecutive mora that are
identical

###Rule 2

Once a standalone word or standalone word
and particle experiences a downstep, it
will never go back up.

    Low-High  High-Low  Low-High-Low

High-Low-High does not exist


##Pitch Accent Patterns

The pitch of the connecting particle depends on
the pitch accent pattern.

###1. あたまだか（頭高）
High-Low

Particle is low

でんきが　－　あいさつが

###2.へいばん（平板）
Low-High

Particle is high

がくせいが

###3.なかだか（中高）
Low-High-Low

Words can start low, go high, and stay
high before dropping off. However, the
final mora and particle will always be low,
so the downstep must occur before then.

Particle is low

にほんじんが

###4.おだか（尾高）
Low-High particle low

Start low, remains high for the whole
word, and downstep for the particle

おとうとが


####Downstep cannot occur on the ん syllable, so it gets shifted one mora early
