###Pitch

The high or low tones of a word or a phrase.
From a technical standpoint, Japanese only
has a high or a low tone. High pitch doesn't
equal high volume

###Stress

The amount of force applied to certain syllable,
word, or phrase. Stress is not present in Japanese. English
and German have strong and weak bits, and
Japanese has high and low bits.

###Accent

Socio-linguistic definition: General spoken 
characteristics of a language. 

Phonetic definition - Some distinct emphasis put
on part of word or the whole word in a language.

Stress and pitch are tools used to convey
accent. Stress accent vs Pitch accent

###Downstep

3 generalized pitch patterns:

Low-High, High-Low, Low-High-Low

The last 2 experience downsteps, or falls
in pitch. This change is classified as
the accent (phonetic prominence). Thus
low-high words don't have an accent

###Mora

A syllable, but counted slightly differently.
All full sized hiragana/katakana characters
count as one mora. 

どうげん - 4 mora, 2 syllables

かいししゃ　- 3 mora

Small tsu counts as a mora

Use mora and not syllables for Japanese pitch
accent

###Intonation

Different from pitch accent. How a pitch
accent for a word changes based on emotion.

Words can exhibit stress as well. Stress
is within the framework of the pitch accent

high - low - low

higher - low - low

Not: low - high - low
